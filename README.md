# Project Euler
## Golang solutions to various problems.

This is my collection of solutions to the problems found at [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net), solved in Golang as a way to help myself learn this wonderful language.

The solutions are not currently the most optimized pieces of code, and surely not 100% Golang idiomatic, but as I learn more and more of the language, I will go back and optimize my code.

Please try to come up with your Project Euler solutions, or at the very least try to understand the code you're looking up â€“ The gratification of solving the problems yourself are fantastic, and it shows how you're clearly progressing and learning.
